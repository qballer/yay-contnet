Through out my life I've been in front of computers. It started with playing with commands in DOS. Then applications on windows. 
As time passed and it turned into running game servers, connecting to closed BBS networks, chat servers, the internet and coding. 
This place is meant to be a mesh between old school my-homepage, personal blog and code playground.
